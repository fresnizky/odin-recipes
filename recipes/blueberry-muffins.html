    <p>
      These blueberry muffins are extra large and yummy with a sugary-cinnamon
      crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just
      to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add
      extra blueberries if you want!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Muffins</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crumb Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups
        or line with paper liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in
        a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to
        reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and
        mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a
        small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top.
        Sprinkle with crumb topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a
        muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
