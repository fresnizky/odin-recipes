    <p>
      This vanilla cake recipe is great for all occasions and easy to make. It's
      the best cake I have ever made. It's not too bland, and it's not too
      sweet. Slice the cooled cake through the middle to make two layers and
      frost as desired.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 pinches salt</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake
        tin with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a
        large bowl. Add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil; mix by hand or beat with
        an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Add more flour if batter is
        too runny. Pour into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
        the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 5
        minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake
        carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
